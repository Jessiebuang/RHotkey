Overview
This README provides instructions for using the AHK script designed for the Rabbit_Lidar_Annotation_Dynamic project.
The script includes several hotkeys for navigation and control within the project.

Note: Ensure you're in Focus Mode for optimal functionality.

Getting Started
Use CTRL + C to copy all text to the clipboard.
Use CTRL + I to display the README.

Hotkey Behavior:
CapsLock is disabled while the hotkey is active and will function like Shift.
This hotkey will generate an ImNotaVirus.txt file to save your preferences.

Interface Settings:
The ON/OFF toggle is positioned at the top of the taskbar for visibility.

Modified Keys: Can be combined with Shift for additional functionality.
On-Screen Hotkey Status:

File Management
